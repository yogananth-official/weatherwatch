      <br><h4>1.CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h4><br><p>We’ll amend this Privacy Policy from time to time to ensure it remains up-to-date and accurately reflects how and why we use your personal data. The current version of our Privacy Policy will always be posted on our website.</p><br><p><b>NOTE ON COMPLIANCE WITH THE GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION AS PERTAINING TO USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA DATA WITHIN weather watch PROJECTS</b></p><br><p>The Centre for the Analysis of Social Media (CASM) often conducts research which involves the collection and analysis of publicly available data from social media platforms.  Much of this data, including usernames, is considered personal data under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In order to ensure this data is processed lawfully and transparently, the following procedures are followed by CASM projects undertaken by weather watch:</p><br><p><ul><li>All data collected from social media platforms is accessed through the official application programming interface (API) of that platform, and stored and used in compliance with that API’s terms of service.</li><br><li>Data is only collected from platforms for which users have provided clear consent, as defined in Article 4(11) of the GDPR, to provide that platform with published data</li><br><li>weather watch will maintain a publicly accessible page on its website for each project, explaining the sources and character of data collected for that project, the purposes for which this data will be used, and including contact details for a designated member of staff responsible for responding to public queries about this data.</li><br><li>Where quotes from social media users are published in reports, these quotes are bowdlerised – altered in a way which preserves meaning but prevents retroactive identification of the original post through e.g an online search. An occasional exception to this policy is observed when the user is publically known to the extent that they would not reasonably expect their social media posts to be private. It should be noted here that the GDPR only applies to natural persons, and not companies or organisations.</li><br><li>CASM does not publish any personal data collected during its research, nor is personal data shared with third parties external to CASM or transferred out of the UK, without the explicit consent of the data subject. Any data published or shared with a third party is aggregated, anonymised or altered to prevent identification a natural person.</li></ul></p><br><p>This Privacy Policy was last updated on 05.06.2023</p>
